It can be cat controlled and there are a lot of different accesories, some of them from xiegu other from third parties. If you lookup on internet about how to use the g90 for digital modes, all the informaiton that you will find will tell you that you have to buy some piece of equipment. I'm here to tell you that's not true, you only will need a single cable that can be made by yourself for free if you have old cables or for 5 euros or so if you buy everything. Having these fancy interfaces is more comfortable and can be required on some scenarios but they are not an aboslute requirement to do digital modes like ft8.
