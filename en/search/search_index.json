It can be cat controlled and there are a lot of different accesories, some of them from xiegu other from third parties. If you lookup on internet about how to use the g90 for digital modes, all the information that you will find will tell you that you have to buy some piece of equipment.</p> <p>I'm here to tell you that's not true, you only will need a single cable that can be made by yourself for free if you have old cables or for 5 euros or so if you buy everything. Having these fancy interfaces is more comfortable and can be required on some scenarios but they are not an aboslute requirement to do digital modes like ft8.</p>"},{"location":"Transmitters/Xiegu%20G90/Digital-Modes/#how-to-create-an-acc-cable","title":"How to create an acc cable","text":"<p>This is the diagram of the required cable.

Sadly i wasn't able to receive them so it was pointless to call them, also there where a huge pileup with much more power and better antennas than me.</p> <p>In any case the cable worked fine, I have to manually adjust the frecuency at the transceiver since I don't have cat control but it wasn't a problem at all, just a sigly inconvenience.</p> <p>This cable allowed me to do my first qso ever in ft8 with IZ2OAR around 2900 km away from me.
