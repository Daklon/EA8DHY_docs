I needed an antenna that can fit the window, a not too big one. Also the antenna must be a dual band antenna, I dind't like the idea to have to change the antenna each time that I need to switch from one band to another. Also if it was a cheap and easy antenna then so much the better. Lastly, something that wasn't required but makes my life easier was a rigid design, this design saves me from have to build support structures for the wire.</p> <p>M0MSN's antenna checks all of those requirements, two dipoles joined by a single coaxial connector, working for 2 meter and 70 cm band.</p> <p>The only thing that I have to bought was the hangers, all of my hanger are made from wood. I already had everything else (a so239 connector and some wire).</p> <p>I didn't have any pictures of the building process but M0MSN makes an excellent job explaining it at his video. I can confirm that this is an easy and quick antenna to build.</p> <p>This is the final result, for the base i used a piece of plastic that I had hanging around. To join the antenna with the fishing pole I just used some tape. I don't have any plans to use this fishing pole for anything else in the near future.</p> <p> </p> <p>Using the NanoVNA I saw that the antenna was sigthly out of bands, but with some trimming I'm convinced that I can do a better match. In any case now it's working fine for me for some local nets and to reach some repeaters. This was just a test so probably I will end building a better version.</p>"},{"location":"Antennas/CB-T2TL/","title":"CB T2TL","text":"<p>In progress</p>"},{"location":"Transmitters/Stefan-Simple-transmitter/","title":"Stefan Simple transmitter","text":""},{"location":"Transmitters/Stefan-Simple-transmitter/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Original youtube video</p> <p>Arduino mod by PU2CLR</p>"},{"location":"Transmitters/Xiegu%20G90/Digital-Modes/","title":"Digital Modes","text":"<p>The xiegu g90 is capable of doing digital modes like ft8 or winlink. It can be cat controlled and there are a lot of different accesories, some of them from xiegu other from third parties. If you lookup on internet about how to use the g90 for digital modes, all the information that you will find will tell you that you have to buy some piece of equipment.</p> <p>I'm here to tell you that's not true, you only will need a single cable that can be made by yourself for free if you have old cables or for 5 euros or so if you buy everything. Having these fancy interfaces is more comfortable and can be required on some scenarios but they are not an aboslute requirement to do digital modes like ft8.</p>"},{"location":"Transmitters/Xiegu%20G90/Digital-Modes/#how-to-create-an-acc-cable","title":"How to create an acc cable","text":"<p>This is the diagram of the required cable.

Sadly i wasn't able to receive them so it was pointless to call them, also there where a huge pileup with much more power and better antennas than me.</p> <p>In any case the cable worked fine, I have to manually adjust the frecuency at the transceiver since I don't have cat control but it wasn't a problem at all, just a sigly inconvenience.</p> <p>This cable allowed me to do my first qso ever in ft8 with IZ2OAR around 2900 km away from me. Not bad for the really bad and simple antenna that i was using at the moment.</p> <p></p>"}]}
