Work in progress

The idea behind this antenna is from M0MSN, he made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PniH4ua4p50) during the quarantine where he shows how to build a dual band dipole using just two hangers.

At my current QTH i don't have any access to the roof, neither have a balcony or anything close to it, so my only hope was to take out an antenna through the window only while I'm on air. I needed an antenna that can fit the window, a not too big one. Also the antenna must be a dual band antenna, I dind't like the idea to have to change the antenna each time that I need to switch from one band to another. Also if it was a cheap and easy antenna then so much the better. Lastly, something that wasn't required but makes my life easier was a rigid design, this design saves me from have to build support structures for the wire.

M0MSN's antenna checks all of those requirements, two dipoles joined by a single coaxial connector, working for 2 meter and 70 cm band.

The only thing that I have to bought was the hangers, all of my hanger are made from wood. I already had everything else (a so239 connector and some wire).

I didn't have any pictures of the building process but M0MSN makes an excellent job explaining it at his video. I can confirm that this is an easy and quick antenna to build.

This is the final result, for the base i used a piece of plastic that I had hanging around. To join the antenna with the fishing pole I just used some tape. I don't have any plans to use this fishing pole for anything else in the near future.

Using the NanoVNA I saw that the antenna was sigthly out of bands, but with some trimming I'm convinced that I can do a better match. In any case now it's working fine for me for some local nets and to reach some repeaters. This was just a test so probably I will end building a better version.
